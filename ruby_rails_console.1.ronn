Ruby on Rails Console
====================

## Reloading the Console Environment:
    >> reload!
    >> Dispatcher.reset_application!   # (outdated)

## Load and execute a Ruby script:
    >> load "the_file_name.rb"

## Using app object:
    >> app.get '/stories/10002'
    => 200
    >> app.assigns(:story)
    => #<Story:0x24aad0c ... >
    >> app.path
    => "/stories/10002"
    >> app.reset!
    => nil

## Using helpers methods:
    >> helper.pluralize 2, "story"
    => "2 stories"

## Clear the console:
    ctrl + l or Command + k (Mac)

## How-to Examine Routes:
    rs = ActionController::Routing::Routes
    puts rs.routes
    rs.recognize_path "/session"
    rs.generate :controller => "users", :action => "edit", :id => "4"

## Print as YAML
    >> y @something

Start in a sandbox (any modifications you make to the database will be rolled back on exit)
    $ ./script/console -s
